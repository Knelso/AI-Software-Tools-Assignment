# 1 What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?

TensorFlow is an open-source ML framework developed by Google. It's mainly used for deep learning and supports both CPU and GPU acceleration. Some cool features include automatic differentiation, TensorBoard for visualization, and the ability to run on mobile and web.

# 2 What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (define the graph first, then execute), while PyTorch has dynamic computation graphs (builds the graph as it runs), making it more flexible and Pythonic.

# 3 What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?

Keras is a high-level deep learning API that makes building neural networks super easy. It can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano (though kinda outdated now), and CNTK.

# 4 What are the key features of Scikit-learn?

Scikit-learn is a popular ML library in Python. It has easy-to-use tools for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. Plus, it's built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

# 5 What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive coding environments mainly used for data science and ML. Features? You can write and run code, add markdown, visualize data, and document everything in one place. Super useful for experiments and sharing research.

# 6 In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?

Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons during training. This forces the network to learn more general patterns instead of memorizing the data.

# 7 What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?

The optimizer updates the model’s weights to minimize the loss function. In PyTorch, Adam is commonly used because it adapts learning rates and works well for deep learning.

# 8 In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?

Conv2D is used in CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes in images. It applies filters to extract features.

# 9 What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?

Usually, it's a classification model like Logistic Regression or Random Forest, and it’s applied to datasets like Iris or MNIST.

# 10 What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?

Most likely, a graph or chart, and it's probably generated using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
